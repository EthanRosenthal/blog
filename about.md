Having spent many years within the comfy confines of MATLAB, I have finally started exploring the wide world of possibilites that exist outside of that expensive IDE. I invite you to come along with me while I document my journey into the great, open source, unknown.

My name is Ethan Rosenthal, and I am currently a sixth-year PhD student studying experimental condensed matter physics at Columbia University in New York, NY.

For more information about my academic research, check out my [website](http://ethanrosenthal.com).

For the code behind this blog and other projects of mine, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/EthanRosenthal).
