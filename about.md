My name is Ethan Rosenthal, and I am a data scientist at [Birchbox](http://www.birchbox.com) in NYC. Before this, I got a PhD in physics at Columbia University. This blog serves as a public record of anything "data"-related that *piques* my interest ([hence the title of the blog](http://youtu.be/xECUrlnXCqk)).
